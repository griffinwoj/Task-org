## Description

You will see a landing page with a link to a notes page when you first open the app. When you click on this link, a new page will open with a list of all the current notes in the left-hand column and blank slots for new note titles and texts in the right-hand column.

A Save icon will show up on the navigation bar at the top of the page as you type the title and content of a new note. Simply click on this symbol to save your new note, and it will then show up with your other saved notes in the left-hand column.

Your previous notes are easily accessible by clicking on them in the left-hand column. You can examine and edit the selected note after it appears in the right-hand column.

Simply select the Write icon from the navigation bar at the top of the page to start a new note. By clicking here, you'll be taken to a screen with blank fields where you may type in a new note's title and text.

The Note Taker app is the ideal option for anyone who wants to keep their thoughts and duties organized while on the road thanks to its easy functionality and intuitive design. Now that you have everything downloaded, start making notes!
